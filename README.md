## Predicting Type of Physical Activity from Accelerometer Data

#### *HarvardX Final Project: Using Python for Research Certification*

### Installation

	Python versions 3.*.
    Python libraries:
        Numpy
		Pandas
		Scipy
		Sklearn
        Matplotlib

### Project Motivation

This is the capstone project of a HarvardX Data Science course that we had to develop from scratch. The objective was to predict the type of physical activity (e.g., walking, climbing stairs) from tri-axial smartphone accelerometer data. At this time I was focusing on using the methods we learnt during the course, in retrospect I couldhave achieved better results with better feature engineering such as taking rolling averages and other aggregations over 1-2 second ranges of data.

### File Descriptions

	It consists of a single Jupyter notebook file:
		PH526x_final_project.ipynb
		
	and four data files:
		train_time_series.csv
		train_labels.csv
		test_time_series.csv
		test_labels.csv
